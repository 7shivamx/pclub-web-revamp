I"Ð<p>Miranda lives in a city containing N junctions and M bidirectional roads between some pairs of these junctions.Miranda is a programming enthusiast - though in  her spare time she does make time for a bit of creative writing . She takes part in Individual Creative Penning Contest organized by the Annual Cultural Melange (ACM ICPC) . The competition is on Sunday and it is already Saturday . Miranda realizes she needs to buy K items for her competition tomorrow . Each of these K items can be found in exactly one junction in her city.</p>

<p>Miranda has to starts from her school which is located in junction number 1 and ultimately must reach her home , in junction number N . On her way , Miranda must visit each of the K junctions that keep the materials required for her competition . Miranda can visit these K junctions in any order , and in doing so can cross a particular city multiple times if she needs to .</p>

<p>You must find the minimum distance that Miranda must cover from her school to home such that she visits each of the K junctions atleast once.</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong><br />
The first line contains the integers N,M and K.<br />
The next M lines are of the form : <em>u v c</em> which denotes there is a bidirectional road joining u and v which is of length c.<br />
The next line contains K integers-the numbers of the junctions that Miranda has to visit on her path .</p>

<p><strong>Output</strong><br />
Print a single integer-the answer to the problem stated above.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong><br />
2&lt;=N&lt;=400<br />
1&lt;=M&lt;=N*(N-1)/2  <br />
0&lt;=K&lt;=15 <br />
1&lt;=u,v&lt;=N,1&lt;=c&lt;=1000  <br />
None of the K junctions that has the material that Miranda needs is 1 or N.</p>
