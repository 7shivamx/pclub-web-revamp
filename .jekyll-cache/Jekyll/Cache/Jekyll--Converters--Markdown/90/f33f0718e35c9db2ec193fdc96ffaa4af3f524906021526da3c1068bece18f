<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>This summer, the programming club has many activities planned, including
lectures on open-source, web-dev, competitive programming and more. We also plan to
conduct a hackathon to give people an opportunity to work on stuff and learn new technologies
like Django, Node.JS, Ruby on Rails, etc.</p>
