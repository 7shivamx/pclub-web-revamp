<p>Programming Club (or PClub) is a community of students highly enthusiastic about coding, ethical hacking, Web Designing and all other aspects of programming. We are a team currently of 4 coordinators (pre-final year) and 24 secretaries (sophomores).</p>

<p>Our Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pclubiitk/">page</a> boasts around 1.7K followers and is a hub for programming-related posts and information. We use it to share exciting updates, promote events, engage with our community, and put out informative posts that keep our followers up-to-date on the latest in the programming world.</p>

<p>We organize activities related to Development (Web Development, Open Source, Game/App Development), programming contests, hackathons, Capture The Flag contests, et all. Lecture series are regularly taken on algorithms, web hijacking, development, among other things.</p>

<p>Programming Club is also dedicated to developing various applications that are beneficial for the campus junta, such as Puppy Love (during Valentineâ€™s week), Student Search, Linux Install fest, and promoting open-source software.</p>

<p>During summers, we offer a large number of projects to the first year students through our Summer Camp. The 2022 Summer Camp saw close to 300 applicants.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact any of our members any time in case of any queries! We hang out on <a href="https://discord.gg/RGSSrYDTKw">Discord</a></p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
