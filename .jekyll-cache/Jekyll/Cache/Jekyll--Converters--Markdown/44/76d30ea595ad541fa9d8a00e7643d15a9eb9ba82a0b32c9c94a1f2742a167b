<ol>
  <li>1 &lt;= i &lt;=N</li>
  <li>gcd(i,N) = i</li>
</ol>

<p>He then gives this sum to Suresh . If the sum is double the value of N Suresh says “YES” otherwise Suresh says “NO” . One morning Suresh doesn’t turn up . So he gives Suresh’s task to you . Given the value of N , print “YES” if the above sum is twice the value of N or “NO” if otherwise .</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong>  <br />
The first line of the input contains a single integer T-denoting the number of test cases.  <br />
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.</p>
