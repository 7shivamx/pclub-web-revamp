Programming Club (or PClub) is a community of students highly enthusiastic about coding, ethical hacking, Web Designing and all other aspects of programming. We are a team currently of 4 coordinators (pre-final year) and 25 secretaries (sophomores)</p>

<p>We organize activities related to Development (Web Development, Open Source, Game/App Development), programming contests, hackathons, Capture The Flag contests, et all. Lecture series are regularly taken on algorithms, web hijacking, development, among other things.</p>

<p>Apart from this, we also develop various applications to be used by the campus junta; like Puppy Love (during valentines week), organize activities like Linux Install fest, and promote Open Source.</p>

<p>During summers, we offer a large number of projects to the first year students through our Summer Camp. The 2016 Summer Camp saw close to 350 applicants.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact any of our members any time in case of any queries! We hang out on IRC at #pclub</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
