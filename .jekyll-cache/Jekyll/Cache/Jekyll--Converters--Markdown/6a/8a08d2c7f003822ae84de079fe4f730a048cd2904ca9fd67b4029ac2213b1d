I"b<p>You run a chemical laboratory which contains <strong>N</strong> beakers containing certain amount of solutions. The i<sup>th</sup> beaker contains a<sub>i</sub> ml of a reactant solution. There also <strong>M</strong> chemists waiting outside your laboratory. Each chemist has a parchment of paper which has 3 integers written on it. The i<sup>th</sup> chemist’s parchment contains 3 integers of the form: <strong>l<sub>i</sub> r<sub>i</sub> x<sub>i</sub></strong></p>

<p>It denotes that the i<sup>th</sup> chemist needs atleast x<sub>i</sub> ml of reactant solution but you can only take it from the bottles numbered l<sub>i</sub> to r<sub>i</sub>. If you are able to meet the i<sup>th</sup> chemists needs, he is happy .</p>

<p>To put it more succinctly, to make the i<sup>th</sup> chemist happy, it should be possible to take some beakers from l<sub>i</sub> to r<sub>i</sub> such that the sum of their solutions is at least x<sub>i</sub>.</p>

<p>Print the number of chemists that returned happy after their transaction with you .</p>

<p>Please note that a transaction with one chemist is independent of that with another chemist , that is the the values of the beakers doesn’t change for a new transaction. For each transaction consider that the values to be those that were there initially.</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong>:</p>

<p>The first line contains 2 integers N and M.<br />
The next line contains N integers, the i<sup>th</sup> integer denoting a<sub>i</sub>.<br />
The next M lines are of the form: l<sub>i</sub> r<sub>i</sub> x<sub>i</sub></p>

<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>

<p>Output a single integer: the number of happy chemists.</p>
