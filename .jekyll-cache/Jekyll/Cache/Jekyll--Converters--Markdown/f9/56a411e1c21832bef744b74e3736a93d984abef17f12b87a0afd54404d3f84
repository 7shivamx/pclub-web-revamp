I"h<p>It can be intimidating to contribute to open source. Making a Pull Request (PR) is the first barrier you need to overcome. To encourage everyone, Programming Club is awarding a free T-Shirt to anyone who makes his/her first successful Pull Request to a reputable third party repository.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NFf5CQ6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>To qualify for the prize, the repository needs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be older than 15th January 2017.</li>
  <li>Must be owned by someone outside of IIT Kanpur.</li>
  <li>Must have at least 200 stars in GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<p>So get to work, and shoot us an email on our <a href="mailto:pclubiitk@gmail.com">official Email-ID</a> the moment you succeed in getting your first PR accepted!</p>
